        My Dear Love.
     </h2>
    <p class="in">
        It has been 1 year and 5 months since we have been together but it feels like ages. The way we are together after sacrificing and fighting so m uch i dont know what to tell you because words get less to tell you but if its not you then its definitely you. You are the one who is the backbone of our togetherness all due to your unbreathable efforts and compromise. Touch wood you are a lovely lady with lots of comedy and charmness and yo are the no one voice artist.
        <br>
        Shreyashi as the word means that you bring achievements. but this time i feel like i have achieved you. These lines may sound stupid but i have never thought that i will really be able to travel with you this long. Do you know one thing? Whenever you say me that i am happy with you or not, i dont say anything at all because my expresions are so huge that they wont come out easily. Yes i am happy with you, more than happy because no one in half of my life supported me like you, called my name by baby voice or even care to feed me when i am down and hungry.
        <br>
        I have so much to say you but some things will be good to hear from me. All i want to say that i love you most and i will be a good man for you. Happy Valentines day love. Forever yours.
